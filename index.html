	    <p>
		   I come from Fontainebleau and at the moment i am studying at ESSEC Business School in Cergy. I am interested in the analysis of corporate financial statements and fundraising operations in the form of capital increases or bond issues, as well as in the strategy of companies to create and maintain investor confidence. 
		   I just found my first year internship in financial communication. This internship will allow me to put my theoretical training into practice for companies seeking financial resources that must convince investors to invest in them. Later on, I would like to intervene to enhance the image of companies with investors who may provide them with the financial resources necessary for their development.

            <h2> Piano üéπ</h2>
	         <p>
		        I have been playing the piano since i am 6 years old, and it is still a passion even if i don't have a lot of time to play. I mainly play classical music like Chopin, but I also like to compose my own pieces.

    	   <h2> Volunteering üè®</h2>
	       <p> 
		        I am a volunteer for the association "les blouses roses" which cares for hospitalized children and elderly people. This association was created in 1944 to fight against isolation of young patients suffering from tuberculosis. It brings together volunteers who mother, comfort and stimulate. I take care of children, coming for consultations at the hospital.

		<h2> Travelling ‚úàÔ∏èüåá</h2>

	         <p>
                 
	            I haven't travelled much in my life, but the amount of travelling I have done has made me realise how much I enjoy discovering new countries and cultures.  I have been to the United States, Italy, England, Scotland, Ireland and i hope i will be able to visit many more countries in the future when the current situation improves.
